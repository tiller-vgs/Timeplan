# Timeplan
This is mostly a prototype for a possible schedule for a school

## How to run
Make sure you are in the correct folder and run npm install first. Then run npm run dev to start the application.

## Content
It currently conists of two pages, a homepage and a page for the schedule. The schedule is currently static but there were plans to connect it to a database and update information according to that database but we didn't make it in time.
The current website is only a representation of how it could look like.
